# data-science-global-sugar-consumption-trends

## Project Overview
This project analyzes global sugar consumption trends across 200+ countries from 1960 to 2023 using a comprehensive dataset that includes economic indicators, agricultural metrics, public health statistics, and policy interventions. Through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), policy regression, machine learning modeling, and policy simulations, the project uncovers the relationships between sugar intake and socioeconomic factors, assesses the impact of government interventions, and builds predictive models to support future policy planning.
